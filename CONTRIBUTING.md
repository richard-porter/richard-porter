# Contributing

These repositories are open, voluntary research and documentation projects within the **Frozen Kernel ecosystem** — all focused on safe, sovereign human-AI collaboration.

Everything here is a living draft. Contributions right now are genuinely useful and directly help shape the work.

## What’s Most Needed

- **Real-world testing & replication** — Try the practices, diagnostics, scorecards, protocols, or field-guide tools and share what actually happened (positive results, failures, edge cases, or null results).  
- **Clarity and usability feedback** — Edits that make things easier to read, better examples, additional citations, or improved diagrams/tables.  
- **New case studies or examples** — Especially from creative, therapeutic, enterprise, research, or high-stakes domains.  
- **Translations or accessibility improvements** — Helping more people access the material.  
- **Cross-repository connections** — Noticing useful links or extensions between the repos (e.g., applying a Field Guide skill to a Dimensional Authorship case).  
- Any open questions listed in the repo’s README.

## How to Contribute

- **Open an Issue** to ask questions, flag gaps, suggest improvements, propose alternatives, or point to related work.  
- **Open a Pull Request** for direct changes to text, tables, diagrams, or new sections.  
- **Share independent implementations or adaptations** — even if your approach differs, a link or reference is valuable.

## What This Is Not Looking For

- Suggestions to replace deterministic safety mechanisms or the Frozen Kernel foundation with purely probabilistic or “trust the model” approaches.  
- Proposals that remove or weaken human authorization from the decision loop.  
- Feature requests that expand scope beyond safe, sovereign, evidence-based human-AI collaboration.
